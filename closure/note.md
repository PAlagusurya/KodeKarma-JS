## SCOPE:

- Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block are confined to that block and cannot be accessed outside, whereas variables declared with `var` are accessible beyond the block.
- The scope of a variable is determined by its lexical environment, which consists of the local memory and the lexical environment of its parent.
- If a child has access to its parent's lexical environment, it can reference variables and functions declared within its parent.
- The JavaScript engine first looks for a variable in the current local environment. If not found, it searches in the parent's lexical environment, continuing up the chain until it reaches `null`. This process is known as the **scope chain**. If the variable is not found anywhere in this chain, it is considered out of scope.
- Shadowing occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in the outer scope, effectively overriding it within that scope.
- Illegal Shadowing happens when a variable declared with var (which has function or global scope) is accessible outside its block, and then a let or const variable with the same name is declared in the same scope, leading to an error.
- A function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure. When a function is returned, even if its execution context is gone, it still remembers the references it was pointing to. Itâ€™s not just the function that is returned, but the CLOSURE itself.
